# Java GUI Explorations with JavaFX

Over this past weekend, I dove into the world of Java GUI development and had the opportunity to explore the powerful JavaFX library. As a beginner, I was able to create several mini-projects that showcase the capabilities of this amazing toolkit.

## Mini-Projects

### 1. Web Browser 🌐

A basic web browser application built using the JavaFX WebEngine. Features include:
- Navigation controls (back, forward, home, reload)
- History tracking
- URL input field

- See the temperature value displayed
- Observe the application color change in real-time

### 5. Age Checker 🎉

An age checker application that determines whether the user is an adult or not. Users can:

- Enter their age in a text field
- Click a button to check their adult status
- See a message displayed indicating if they are an adult or not

## Getting Started 

To run these mini-projects, you'll need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. You can download the necessary dependencies from the OpenJFX website.

Once you have the requirements set up, you can clone this repository and run the individual project folders in your preferred Java IDE.

## Feedback and Contributions

I'm always eager to learn and improve, so please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions on these mini-projects. If you'd like to contribute or build upon these ideas, I welcome pull requests and collaboration opportunities.

Let's explore the world of Java GUI development together!
