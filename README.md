Java GUI Explorations with JavaFX
Over this past weekend, I dove into the world of Java GUI development and had the opportunity to explore the powerful JavaFX library. As a beginner, I was able to create several mini-projects that showcase the capabilities of this amazing toolkit.

Mini-Projects
1. Web Browser üåê
A basic web browser application built using the JavaFX WebEngine. Features include:
Navigation controls (back, forward, home, reload)
History tracking
URL input field

3. Image Slider üñºÔ∏è
An image slider application with login and logout functionality. Users can:
View a carousel of images
Log in and out of the application
Customize the image carousel

3. Music Player üéµ
A music player application that allows users to play their favorite playlists. Key features:
Playback controls (play, pause, next, previous, volume)
Customizable playback speed
Playlist management

5. Temperature Meter üå°Ô∏è
A temperature meter application that changes color based on the selected temperature. Users can:
Adjust the temperature using a slider
See the temperature value displayed
Observe the application color change in real-time


Getting Started
To run these mini-projects, you'll need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. You can download the necessary dependencies from the OpenJFX website.

Once you have the requirements set up, you can clone this repository and run the individual project folders in your preferred Java IDE.

Feedback and Contributions
I'm always eager to learn and improve, so please feel free to provide any feedback or suggestions on these mini-projects. If you'd like to contribute or build upon these ideas, I welcome pull requests and collaboration opportunities.

Let's explore the world of Java GUI development together!
